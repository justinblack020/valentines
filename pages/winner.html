You are the sweetest, most caring, prettiest, and kindest person I've ever met. I love doing things with you whether it is getting food or tickle fights or even forcing you to watch football. I know that there are things I can do better (like explaining the stuff I'm working on instead of keeping it to myself), so I'll try my best to work harder at those things, because you deserve it. I love you pookie! And Gosh, this font is so difficult to read, so if you made it to the end of this, that's awesome.
